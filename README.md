# Gigabot 3 Mods
This repo is here to document modifications I made to the Gigabot XLT 3+. More details on the mods can be found in the Wiki.

## Background

My work purchased this [Gigabot XLT 3+](https://shop.re3d.org/pages/gigabot-xlt-3-tech-specs) a while back, looking for large format printing capability. While we did get some good prints from this printer, I found it to be pretty unreliable. As time went on, it got worse and for the last few years, it has been sitting broken in the basement of my workplace. They eventually decided to cut their losses and get rid of the printer, so I took it home. This repo documents my efforts to get the printer running again and hopefully fix some of the issues we found.

## Wishlist

Here is a list of the various things I hope to do with this printer.

Required:
- [x] Get the printer running with an upgraded firmware.
- [ ] Add a bed sensor for auto bed leveling.
- [ ] Replace the X and Y motor mounts with machined versions.
- [ ] Rebuild the print head.
- [ ] Move the thermocouple amplifier for the bed thermocouple to avoid interference with the AC bed heater.

Optional:
- [ ] Update Y endstops to optical sensors.
- [ ] Replace motor drivers with more modern variants.
